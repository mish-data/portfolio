## Projects
### Training a basic Neural Network from first principles
[Readme File](https://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/22/8/3048)

Utilising **R** to classify hawks into three species by constructing a basic (8)-network from first principles that uses body weight and wing length as classifiers. The goal is to use measurements alone to automate the process of classifying hawks into species. This is a demonstration of my understanding of neural networks.

### Decoding Physical and Cognitive Impacts of Particulate Matter Concentrations at Ultra-Fine Scales
[Publication](https://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/22/11/4240)

Used **Matlab** to train over 100 machine learning models which estimated particulate matter concentrations based on a suite of over 300 biometric variables. We found biometric variables can be used to accurately estimate particulate matter concentrations at ultra-fine spatial scales with high fidelity (r2 = 0.91) and that smaller particles are better estimated than larger ones. Inferring environmental conditions solely from biometric measurements allows us to disentangle key interactions between the environment and the body.
